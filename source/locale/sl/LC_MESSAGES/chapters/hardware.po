"DJ controllers are devices with knobs, faders, buttons, and jog wheels to "
"control DJ software such as Mixxx. Controllers allow quick access to "
"different controls while providing tactile and visual feedback indicating "
"the state of each control, such as the position of a knob or whether a "
"switch is on or off. This allows you to focus on manipulating the music "
"without needing to look at your computer screen all the time. Controllers "
"also allow using two hands to manipulate two different controls at the same "
"time, which is required for many mixing techniques."

"Kontrolerji za DJ-anje so naprave z regulatorji, drsniki, gumbi in jog "

"povratno informacijo o stanju posameznih upravljalnikov. Na primer položaj "
"regulatorja in ali je stikalo vklopljeno ali izklopljeno. To vam omogoča, da"
" se posvetite upravljanju glasbe, brez da bi ves čas morali gledati na "
"računalniški zaslon. Kontrolerji prav tako omogočajo istočasno uporabo dveh "

"DJ controllers typically do not do any actual audio processing. Instead, "
"they send signals (typically :term:`MIDI` or :term:`HID` over a USB cable) "

" controllers include an :ref:`audio interface <hardware-audio-interfaces>` "
"with 2 separate stereo outputs built into the device. This allows the DJ to "

"An audio interface (also known as a \"sound card\", although few of them are"

"output to and receive input from audio equipment. Whether using "
":ref:`internal or external mixing <intro-how-mixxx-works>`, it is "

"output channels (2 separate stereo pairs)."

"The headphone jack on most laptops is not a second audio output. Rather, "
"plugging headphones into the jack simply redirects the laptop's single "
"stereo output from its speakers to your headphones. A splitter cable can be "
"used to separate the stereo output of a headphone jack into two separate "
"mono outputs for headphone cueing, but it is recommended to use a sound card"
" with at least four mono outputs (for two stereo pairs). Such sound cards "
"tend to be higher quality than those built into laptops and allow your mix "
"to be enjoyed in stereo by your audience."

"headphone connector. This does not mean that the audio interface can send "
"out 6 different signals at the same time; rather, the signal on 2 of the "

"Turntables output low voltage (phono level) signals that need to be "

"if you want to use :ref:`vinyl-control`, sometimes referred to as a Digital "
"Vinyl System (DVS), it is best to have phono preamplifiers (one for each "
"deck) somewhere between your turntable and sound card to boost the "
"turntable's phono level signal to line level. Mixxx can amplify phono level "
"signals in software, but it is better to do it in hardware. The phono preamp"
" can be in the turntable, in the audio interface, or a stand alone device. "
"Most audio interfaces do not have phono preamps; these are generally found "
"on audio interfaces specifically made for controlling DJ software with "
"timecode vinyl. :ref:`hardware-mixers` with audio interfaces have phono "

"Often DJs who use DJ software with internal mixing send their master output "

"However, using an external mixer with internal mixing is not necessary and "

"through reduces the sound quality, so avoiding unnecessary equipment in the "
"signal path can provide better sound quality. Many DJ controllers provide "
"separate master and booth outputs with independent volume controls. "
