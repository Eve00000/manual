"The audio buffer is the amount of audio in milliseconds that Mixxx processes"
" at a time. This is a major factor that determines the latency between "
"changing controls in Mixxx such as moving the crossfader or pressing the "
"play button and hearing the audio change. For example, with an audio buffer "
"of 23 ms, it will take approximately 23 milliseconds for Mixxx to stop the "
"audio after you toggle the play button. The actual latency will be longer "
"depending on a variety of factors."

msgid ""
"The audio buffer setting determines how quickly your :term:`Operating "
"System` expects Mixxx to react. A smaller audio buffer means Mixxx will be "
"more responsive, but requires a faster CPU and quality audio interface. "
"Setting your audio buffer too small may be too much for your computer and "
"audio interface to handle. In this situation, Mixxx playback will be choppy "
"and very clearly distorted as your system will not be able to keep up with "
"how frequently Mixxx is trying to process audio. It is recommended to set "
"your audio buffer as small as your system can handle reliably without "
"glitches. Experiment with different audio buffer sizes to find what works "
"for your system."

"Mixxx's signal, which is half the sample rate. Humans can only hear up to 20"
" kHz, so there is generally no need to use more than a 44.1 kHz (44100 Hz) "
"sample rate for playback. Most music is published with a 44100 Hz sample "

"slightly reduces sound quality."

"Most modern GNU/Linux distributions use PulseAudio by default. When launched"
" from a GUI menu entry or icon, Mixxx suspends PulseAudio while it is "
"running so that Mixxx can use ALSA directly. Like JACK, PulseAudio allows "
"multiple programs to access one audio interface, but PulseAudio and JACK "
"have opposite design goals. PulseAudio is designed to make ordinary computer"
" usage such as watching videos online and listening to music easy whereas "
"JACK is designed for demanding low latency audio programs like Mixxx. It can"
" be difficult to setup JACK and PulseAudio to work well together. So, unless"
" you already use JACK, it is easiest to let Mixxx suspend PulseAudio and use"
" ALSA."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/preferences.rst:149
msgid ""
"If the PulseAudio plugin for alsalibs is installed on GNU/Linux, you can "
"choose the virtual device ``pulse``. This allows Mixxx to share the default "
"system audio interface with other media players. This only works if you "
"start Mixxx without pasuspender, which you can do by running "
":command:`mixxx` from a console rather than clicking the launcher icon in a "
"menu or on your desktop. Since the sound stream is routed from ALSA to Pulse"
