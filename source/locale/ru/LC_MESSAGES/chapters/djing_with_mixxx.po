msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Setting your levels properly, also known as gain staging, is essential for "
"getting the best sound quality out of the equipment you are using. At every "
"link in your signal chain, from Mixxx's channel gains to the power "
"amplifier, the level should be well above the noise floor, but lower than "
"the maximum level before the signal clips. The :term:`level meters <level "
"meter>` should mostly be around the top of their green region. The level "
"meter pictured to the left shows where Mixxx's level meters should average "
"at the loudest parts of tracks. The average level should not be in the "
"yellow region. Use the yellow region to leave headroom, or available level "
"above the average before the signal clips. The loudest parts of the music "
"(the transients) should briefly go into the yellow region."

"A waveform at a good level. Note that the example waveforms in this section "
"were made by adjusting the visual gain of the waveform display in Mixxx to "
"illustrate the concepts. Adjusting the visual gain of the waveform display "
"does not change the level of the audio."

msgid ""
"**If a level meter is in its red region, the signal is clipping and the gain"
" should be turned down.** Some equipment doesn't have a level meter and only"
" has an LED that turns on when the signal clips. Clipping means that the "
"peaks of the waveform are flattened because the equipment has reached the "
"maximum level that it can amplify the signal to. This distorts sound in an "
"unpleasant way and can damage equipment by driving it with more power than "
"it is designed to handle. Increasing the gain past the point where clipping "
"begins (further into the red on a meter) will distort the signal more. If "
"you want to make the sound louder when every part of the signal chain is at "
"its maximum without clipping, use more speakers or use speakers that are "
"more sensitive and convert electrical energy into acoustic energy more "
"efficiently."

"On the other hand, the signal should not be too low. This is because every "
"audio device generates a little noise at a level referred to as its noise "
"floor. Additionally, analog signals pick up noise as they travel along "
"wires. The signal measured by the meter on the left is relatively close to "
"the noise floor. When a device is turned up, the noise floor does not go up;"
" only the signal does. However, every time the signal is amplified by the "
"gain of another piece of equipment, both the noise and the signal from "
"previous devices in the signal chain are amplified. For example, if your "
"sound card is turned down and you turn the gain up on your mixer to "
"compensate, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the sound card output will be"
" low and the mixer's gain will amplify the signal and the noise from the "
"sound card, plus the noise picked up along the wire. The end result will "
"have more noise than if the output of the sound card was turned up before "
"the signal reached the mixer and the mixer's gain did not have to be turned "
"up."

msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/djing_with_mixxx.rst:108
msgid ""
":term:`Beatmatching` is the process of adjusting the playback rate of a "
"track so that it matches the tempo of another track. Beatmatching also "
"involves adjusting the :term:`phase` of the beats in a track so that they "
"are aligned with the beats in the other track. Matching the :term:`tempo` "
"and aligning the beats are the two things a DJ must do to beatmatch."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/djing_with_mixxx.rst:114
msgid ""
"Mixxx can match the tempo and align the beats for you but this requires an "
"accurately detected BPM value and a correct beat grid for both tracks. To "
"enable this feature, tap the :guilabel:`SYNC` button. To beatmatch manually,"
" the tempo of the two tracks must be synchronized by adjusting the playback "
"rate sliders. You can adjust the phase of the beats by right-clicking and "
"dragging on either waveform display to temporarily speed up or slow down one"
" of the tracks until the beats are aligned. The temporary pitch bend buttons"
" can also be used to momentarily adjust the playback rate, allowing you to "
"“shuffle” the beats in a track forwards or backwards, so they can be aligned"
" with another track. See the chapter :ref:`interface-rate`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/djing_with_mixxx.rst:125
msgid ""
"Two tracks are beatmatched once their tempos are matched and their beats are"
" aligned. A “perfect” beatmatch is nearly impossible - there will always be "
"a tiny difference in the playback rates. A keen DJ will keep his or her ears"
" open and listen for the beats drifting out of alignment. This has a "
"distinct “double bass kick” sound which is often preceded by the kick "
"weakening in intensity as the two kicks drift out of phase. When this "
"happens, the beats can be realigned by simply tapping one of the temporary "
"pitch bend buttons a few times in the appropriate direction."

msgid ""
"To activate Master Sync on a deck, push and hold (or click and hold) the "
":guilabel:`SYNC` button. You'll know Master Sync is on because the sync "
"button will remain lit.  Changing the rate of any deck that has Sync lit "
"will change the rates of all other decks that also have the Sync button lit."
"  There is no need to set specific decks to be a master or followers.  You "
"can play, stop, eject, load, and queue any track with master sync and it "
"won't interrupt the playback of the other decks.  However, changing the rate"
" of a stopped deck will change the rate of playing decks."

"Master Sync will also notice if one of your tracks is double the BPM of "
"another track and match them correctly.  So if you want to mix a 140 BPM "
"drum & bass track with a 70 bpm dubstep track, Master Sync will make sure "
"they are lined up properly."

"Usually, Master Sync will only make sure the rate sliders are set correctly."
"  If you also want to make sure your beats are perfectly in sync, turn on "
